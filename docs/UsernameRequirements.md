## Description

- Username must be **no more than 20 characters** long.
- Username must contain **only alphanumeric characters** (letters and numbers).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Usernames shorter than 3 characters are rejected with an appropriate error message.
- [ ] Usernames longer than 20 characters are rejected with an appropriate error message.
- [ ] Usernames containing non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., `@`, `_`, `!`) are rejected with an appropriate error message.
