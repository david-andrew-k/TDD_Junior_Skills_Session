# Project Setup AI Prompt
This document provides a prompt to generate step-by-step instructions for setting up a Java project environment using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition. 

The prompt is designed to be used with a Generative AI chatbot of your choice (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) to create a comprehensive and easy-to-follow guide, with the added benefit of being able to ask follow-up questions if any part of the instructions are unclear. If you prefer a more traditional approach, you can refer to the [Step-by-Step Project Setup Instructions](ProjectSetupInstructions.md) .

*Please note that the generated instructions may not be perfect, as AI-generated content can sometimes be inconsistent.*

## AI Prompt
```
I am trying to set up a Java project environment using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition. I would like you to generate step-by-step instructions for the setup process. The instructions should include:

1. Downloading and installing IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.
2. Downloading the source code for the project from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/david-andrew-k/TDD_Junior_Skills_Session
3. Opening the project in IntelliJ.
4. Installing and selecting a Java Development Kit version 24 or later.
5. Testing that the project compiles by running the `Main` class.
6. Running the tests in the `UserTest` class.

The instructions should be clear and easy to follow. The target audience is someone who is not familiar with the tools used in this project, so please make the guide as simple and straightforward as possible.
