# TDD Overview
For those new to TDD, the basic cycle is Red-Green-Refactor:

### Red
- **Write a Test**: Start by writing a test for a new feature or piece of functionality.
- **Run the Test**: Run the test to see it fail (since the feature is not yet implemented).
### Green
- **Write Code**: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
- **Run Tests Again**: Run all tests to ensure the new test passes and no other tests are broken.
### Refactor
- **Refactor the Implementation**: Clean up the code while ensuring all tests still pass.
- **Repeat**: Continue this cycle for each new feature.
