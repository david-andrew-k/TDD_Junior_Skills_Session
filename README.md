# TDD Junior Skills Session Demo

This repository provides the structure for a simple demonstration of Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles using Java. This repository has been designed to accompany an introductory session on TDD.

The repository includes a `User` class and a set of validation requirements for Usernames and Passwords. 

## Using This Repository

The goal of this repository is to practice TDD principles by implementing validation logic for usernames and passwords based on the provided requirements.

Requirements for Username and Password validation are provided in separate markdown files: 
- [Username Requirements](docs/UsernameRequirements.md)
- [Password Requirements](docs/PasswordRequirements.md)

Tests should be written first (in the `UserTest` class) to cover the validation rules, followed by the implementation of the validation logic in the `User` class.
